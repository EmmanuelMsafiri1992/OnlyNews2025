● Perfect! Now let's set it up on the NanoPi:

  Step-by-Step Instructions:

  1. Pull the script on NanoPi:

  cd /opt/newsapp
  git pull

  2. Run the setup script:

  cd /opt/newsapp
  sudo bash setup-tv-kiosk.sh

  This will:
  - Install X server and Chromium browser (~5-10 minutes)
  - Create auto-start scripts
  - Configure kiosk mode
  - Set up systemd service

  3. Start the kiosk mode:

  Option A - Start immediately:
  sudo systemctl start tv-kiosk

  Option B - Reboot (recommended):
  sudo reboot

  After reboot, the TV will automatically show your news app in fullscreen!

  What This Does:

  ✓ NanoPi displays directly to TV via HDMI
  ✓ Modern Chromium browser - runs full Vue.js app
  ✓ Fullscreen kiosk mode - no browser UI visible
  ✓ Auto-starts on boot - plug & play
  ✓ Hides mouse cursor - clean display
  ✓ Disables screen blanking - always on
  ✓ Shows EXACT same app as computer - all features work!

  Troubleshooting:

  If the screen stays black after reboot:

  Check service status:
  sudo systemctl status tv-kiosk

  View logs:
  journalctl -u tv-kiosk -f

  Manual test:
  DISPLAY=:0 startx

  Go ahead and run the setup! Let me know when you're ready to start or if you encounter any issues.
